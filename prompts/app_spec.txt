  <overview>
    Business Finder is a global business directory application where users can discover businesses through powerful PostgreSQL full-text search, category browsing, or location-based discovery. Signed-in users can add businesses, write reviews, save favorites, and RSVP to events. Business owners can claim listings, view comprehensive analytics, and respond to reviews (when verified). Platform administrators manage users, verify businesses, and moderate content. The platform supports country-based filtering with automatic detection via IP/browser geolocation. The app features a clean, minimal design inspired by Airbnb with light/dark mode support.
